# Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh]; it enriches the command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes.

## Installation

Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum required version is 4.3.17.

1.  Launch Zsh:

    `zsh`

2.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ladislas/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"`

3.  Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh configuration files provided:

    ```
    setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
    for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
      ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
    done
    ```

    Note: If you already have any of the given config files, ln will error. In simple cases you can add `source "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto/init.zsh"` to the bottom of your `.zshrc` to load prezto but keep your config intact. For more complicated setups, it is recommended that you back up your original configs and replace them with the provided prezto runcoms.

4.  Set Zsh as your default shell:

    `chsh -s /bin/zsh`

5.  Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *Prezto*, modify the `PATH` variable in *\~/.zprofile* then open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

## Updating

Pull the latest changes and update submodules.

```
git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Usage

Prezto has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and accompanying README files to learn of what is available.

### Modules

1.  Browse */modules* to see what is available.
2.  Load the modules you need in *\~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Themes

1.  For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
2.  To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
3.  Load the theme you like in *\~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.
